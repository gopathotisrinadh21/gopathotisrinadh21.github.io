    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>The main of the project is to predict the car price based on the categories.
       we have used machine learning algorithm called Multi linear regression for this project. We had taken the dataset of the cars from the kaggle 
       for which had some categories like Car Company,Car Model, Gear type, Fuel type, Distance driven like this. We had trained the dataset and made to get best accuracy for 
       predicting the car price accurately.

    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>The main of the project is to convert one language to another language. It converts the text from a source language to a target language
        In this i had used python libraries to convert the text from one language to another lanaguage. I had used a Flask framework to link my Python code to HTML page

    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>The main of the project is to detect the object from the image or a video. We had used computervison to detect the object and we had used YOLO technology,
        to detect the object and I had used a python Framework called Flask to connect my python code to HTML page

    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>The main aim of the project is to download youtube videos directly to the downloads folder. It works based on the python library called Pytube
        I had used frontend HTML page for connecting the Python code through the Flask Web Framework.We just need to place the youtube link and then we press
        the download button and it automatically gets download into the download Folder.

    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>The main aim of the project is to remove unwanted,background noise from the given audio file we had used Unsupervised Machine learning Algorithm 
        for removing the background noise from the Audio file.We had used a Web Frame work called Flask to get our python code to HTML page
